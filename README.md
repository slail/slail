# 💫 About Me:

<ul>
  <li> 👀 I'm currently working on a Python Selenium Bot that watches listing on Mercari to update me on the most recent posting on iPhone 13s, and tell me whether or not it's a "good" deal by looking at price and also the seller's ratings.</li>
   <li>🤝 I'm looking for help with making this bot as accurate as possible and minimizing false positives (Bad listings, that the bot suspected to be "good")</li>
  <li>🌱 I'm currently learning more about Python Selenium, which includes web scraping and web browser automation.</li>
  <li>💬 Ask me about why I decided to take on this challenge.<br>⚡Fun Fact: It was because I'm a cheap-stake at times, and want to save money while shopping online during the holidays. </li>
  <li> 📫 How to reach me sbillicko@gmail.com </li>
